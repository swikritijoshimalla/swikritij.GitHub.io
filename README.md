# This is the dataset of A Day in the Life of NYC Taxis. The data was collected based on NYC taxi's running time recorded within a 24 hour time period. The data shows the GPS tracking for where the taxi picked up a passanger and where the passanger was dropped off. The data colleceted shows the number of passsangers the taxi had within that 24 hour time period, fare charges and total earing per right and overall earning for that day. Collecting this data can also help taxi companies adjust the number of taxis in certain areas during peak hours which could help reduce wait times for passengers and ensures that drivers are positioned in areas with high demand.
