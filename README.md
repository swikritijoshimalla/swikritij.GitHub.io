# Data Set: NYC Taxi Data
# URL: https://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/
# This is the dataset of A Day in the Life of NYC Taxis. The data was collected based on NYC taxi's running time recorded within a 24 hour time period. The data shows the GPS tracking for where the taxi picked up a passenger and where the passenger was dropped off. The data collected shows the number of passsengers the taxi had within that 24 hour time period, fare charges, total earning per ride and overall earning for that day. Collecting this data can also help taxi companies adjust the number of taxis in certain areas during peak hours which could help reduce wait times for passengers and ensure that drivers are positioned in areas with high demand.

# I am interested in this book because it gives a good introduction and overview on Data Science and mentions how data analysis is an important component of skill sets that are necessary to be successful in several roles today.
